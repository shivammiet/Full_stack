        <h1>Virat kohli</h1>
        <p>He soon joined the senior Men in Blue in Sri Lanka,
           come August 2008.<span class="emp">In the absence of the regular openers,
           Virat Kohli was given a chance to open the batting in the ODI series.
           He played some commendable knocks in his extended run as an opener,
           as India went on to win the ODI series.</span> However,
           the established and formidable pair of Tendulkar and Sehwag kept Kohli out of the team
           The 20-year-old continued to impress for Delhi and dominated attacks, 
           clearly demonstrating that he belonged at a much higher level; <span class="emp">that junior cricket was beneath his standards.
           Kohli then traveled to Australia in 2009 for the Emerging players tournament and stamped
           his authority all over the bowling attacks. He added 'big-match temperament' to his résumé too, 
           lacing a fluent hundred in the final against South Africa, and guiding his team to a clinical victory. The young prodigy,
           barely old enough to receive his man-of-the-match champagne,</span> ended the tournament with 398 runs from 7 outings with two centuries and two fifties, 
           ensuring that he remained fresh in the selectors' minds.</p>

        <h1>Ms dhoni</h1>
        <p>Less than thirty years before that enchanting 
           Saturday night <span class="emp">when Ravi Shastri’s voice rang
           through television sets all over India,</span> 
           when even the spunky and exuberant
           Indian youth showed more interest in an old-school 
           CRT television at a local chai ki dukaan than 
           the dance-floor at a pub, a pump-operator
           in Ranchi awaited the birth of his third child.</p>
